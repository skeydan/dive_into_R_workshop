  #1
- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we'll get to know compound data structures in R. That is, vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, and data frames.
  
  #2
- Class: text
  Output: Again, at any time, you can enter play() on the console and try out things for yourself.
    In order to continue, just type nxt().

  #3
- Class: text
  Output: OK. Now on to data structures. First, let me say that there really is no difference in R between scalars and non-scalars. 
    All objects are in fact non-scalars.
    
  #4
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For example, the number 122 is in fact just a vector of length 1, containing the number 122. 
    This is the reason you can not just type length(c(111,222,333)), but also length(111) ... do this now to see the output.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('length(111)')
  Hint: Just type length(111).
  
  #5
- Class: text
  Output: Data structures may be classified according to two main criteria - their dimensionality (1, 2, or n-dimensional) as well as
    the homogeneity or heterogeneity of objects they contain.
    
  #6 
- Class: text
  Output: Regarding dimensionality, vectors are one-dimensional, matrices are two-dimensional, and arrays are n-dimensional objects.
    All three have in common that they may only contain one type of object.
    
  #7  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start with vectors. Vectors are created using c(). 
    Create a vector v1 containing the elements "alpha", "beta" and "gamma" (in this order).
  AnswerTests: omnitest('v1 <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma")')
  Hint: Just type v1 <- c("alpha", "beta", "gamma").    
    
  #8  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, create a vector v2 containing the numbers from 33 to 35.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('v2 <- c(33,34,35)', 'v2 <- 33:35')
  Hint: Just type v2 <- c(33,34,35).
  
  #9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, concatenate both vectors and call the result v3.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('v3 <- c(v1,v2)')
  Hint: Just type v3 <- c(v1,v2).
 
  #10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Please print v3 now to see how it looks.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('v3', 'print(v3)')
  Hint: Just type v3. 
  
  #11
- Class: text
  Output: As you see, the result is not a nested vector, but has been flattened. Vectors cannot contain other vectors.
   
 
  #12
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, given that we've concatenated two different data types, what type will the resulting vector have?
    As we said vectors always have to be of a single data type only.
    Go ahead and check (you could use typeof() to get the internal data type, is.numeric() to check for numerical data,
    or is.character to test for character data.)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('typeof(v3)', 'is.character(v3)', 'is.numeric(v3)')
  Hint: Just type typeof(v3).

  #13
- Class: text
  Output: Evidently, the numbers got coerced to strings. (It wouldn't make much sense the other way round.)
  
  #14
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Right now, we've created a numeric vector by enumerating every single item.
    We can create sequences of consecutive numbers in an easier way. Type 1:10 to see what happens.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('1:10')
  Hint: Just type 1:10.
  
  #16
- Class: text
  Output: Yet another way to create a sequence of numbers is using seq().
    seq() takes arguments by and length.out that allow you to specify a step size or the number of intermediate values to generate.
   
  #17
- Class: text
  Output: The syntax is seq(from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),
    length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)
    Here, you see that every parameter has a default value that will be used if you don't pass in anything.

  #18
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, create a vector containing the numbers 10,15,20,25 using seq.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('seq(10,25,5)','seq(10,25, length.out = 4)')
  Hint: Just type seq(10,25,5).
  
  #19
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, create a vector between 0 and 1 containing 10 entries.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('seq(0,1,length.out = 10)')
  Hint: Just type seq(0,1,length.out = 10).
  
  #20
- Class: text
  Output: Let's pass on to lists.
  
  #21
- Class: text
  Output: When you need objects of different types in a one-dimensional container, you use a list instead of a vector.
    Lists can even contain complex data structures like other lists, or dataframes.
  
  #22
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Lists are created with the list() constructor, as in mylist <- list('a',1, TRUE).
    To try this out, create a list mylist containing the numbers from 1 to 3, the boolean FALSE, and the letters from x to z.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('mylist <- list(1, 2, 3, FALSE, "x", "y","z")')
  Hint: Just type mylist <- list(1, 2, 3, FALSE, 'x', 'y','z')
  
  #23
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you did this as expected, you created a flat list, with no substructure.
    Display the list to see how R prints lists.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mylist','print(mylist)')
  Hint: Just type mylist.
  
  #24
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How many elements does mylist have? You can find this out using the length() function.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('length(mylist)')
  Hint: Just type length(mylist).
  
  #25
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Perhaps you initially tried creating mylist using the colon operator.
    To see what happens in this case, create another list, mylist2, containing the same elements but this time, using 1:3 instead of enumerating every single number.
    Also, instead of entering every character by itself, use letters[24:26] to access the last three letters of the alphabet.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('mylist2 <- list(1:3, FALSE, letters[24:26])')
  Hint: Just type mylist2 <- list(1:3, FALSE, letters[24:26]).
  
  #26
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think is the length of this list?
  AnswerChoices: 1;3;6;7
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3')
  
  #27
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now test for yourself.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('length(mylist2)')
  Hint: Just type length(mylist2).
  
  #28
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Also, look how it prints and watch the difference to the first list (mylist).
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mylist2','print(mylist2)')
  Hint: Just type mylist2.
  
  #29
- Class: text
  Output: While you can also name vector elements, this is not usually done.
    With lists, however, it is different.
  
  #30
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First now, find out if mylist2 has any named elements, using names().
  AnswerTests: omnitest('names(mylist2)')
  Hint: Just type names(mylist2).
  
  #31
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So at the moment the elements are not named. 
    You can name them, "after the fact", doing something like names(somelist) <- c(name1, name2, name3, ...)
    I suggest you name the elements of mylist2 "numbers", "logical", and "letters".
    Alternatively, you could have created the list including the names right from the beginning, using key - value pairs.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('names(mylist2) <- c("numbers", "logical", "letters")')
  Hint: Just type names(mylist2) <- c("numbers", "logical", "letters").
  
  #32
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print mylist2 to see how it looks now.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mylist2','print(mylist2)')
  Hint: Just type mylist2.
  
  #34
- Class: text
  Output: While vectors and lists are both one-dimensional data types, one dimension often isn't enough.
    So let's move on to two dimensions.
    
  #35
- Class: text
  Output: Here too, we have to distinguish two cases - homogeneous (all items are of the same type) and heterogeneous containers.
       
  #36
- Class: text
  Output: Homogeneous two-dimensional data is stored in matrices. 
    Matrices are created using the matrix() function, passing in data (mostly as a vector) and telling  how to arrange the data in rows and columns.
    For example, like this. matrix(1:20, nrow = 2, ncol =10)
  
  #37
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To try this out, create a matrix, named m, of uppercase letters, from A to L,with 3 rows and 4 columns.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('m <- matrix(LETTERS[1:12], nrow = 3, ncol = 4)','m <- matrix(LETTERS[1:12], 3,4)')
  Hint: Just type m <- matrix(LETTERS[1:12], nrow = 3, ncol = 4).

  #38
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now have a look at m.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('m','print(m)')
  Hint: Just type m.

  #39
- Class: text
  Output: As you see, the sequence of numbers got stored in column order.
    If you want them stored in row order, you need to tell R in the matrix constructor.
    Matrix() has a byrow parameter for that - you would use byrow=TRUE to force that behavior.
  
  #40
- Class: text
  Output: Matrices can have named rows and named columns.
    Row names are set like this. rownames(m) <- c(<name of first row>,<name of second row> ...).
    Column names are set accordingly.

  #41
- Class: text
  Output: To set both row names and column names at the same time, use dimnames(), passing in a list where the first item is the vector of row names, and the second item is the vector of column names.
   
   
  #42
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The matrix m has 3 rows and 4 columns.
    This can also be seen from the output of nrow() and ncol(), or dim(), which combines both.
    Use dim() to check this now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('dim(m)')
  Hint: Just type dim(m).  

  #43
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can also change dimensions with dim(). Try changing the matrix so it has 6 rows and 2 columns.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('dim(m) <- c(6,2)')
  Hint: Just type dim(m) <- c(6,2).  
  
  #44
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just to see what happened, print the matrix now.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('m','print(m)')
  Hint: Just type m.    
  
  #45
- Class: text
  Output: OK. Now what if you need to have different data types in a two-dimensional (table-like) data structure?
    Like in a database table? ... right. The equivalent in R would be the data.frame.
    
  #46
- Class: text
  Output: In actual work, you will probably see data.frame a LOT.
    On the surface this looks like an Excel sheet.
    Basically, this is just a list of vectors. That is, the columns form a list, and each column is a vector.
    This is why each column may be of a different data type, but has to be homogeneous in itself.
  
  #47  
- Class: text
  Output: You create a data.frame in the same way as you create a list, just using data.frame as a constructor instead of list().
    For example, like this.
    
  #48
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: df <- data.frame(firstcol = 1:3, secondcol = rep(777,3), thirdcol = c('desc', 'anotherdesc', 'yetanotherdesc')).
    Just copy paste this now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("df <- data.frame(firstcol = 1:3, secondcol = rep(777,3), thirdcol = c('desc', 'anotherdesc', 'yetanotherdesc'))")
  Hint: Just type df <- data.frame(firstcol = 1:3, secondcol = rep(777,3), thirdcol = c('desc', 'anotherdesc', 'yetanotherdesc')).  

  #49  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can use the same functions as with matrices to check the dimensions of a data.frame.
    How many rows and columns does df have? 
  AnswerTests: omnitest('dim(df)')
  Hint: Just type dim(df).   
  
  #50
- Class: text
  Output: To find out about the column names, you could use either names() or colnames().
    There's also row.names() (or rownames()) to either get or set row names.

  #51
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To play around with data.frames, no need to create your own. R comes with a lot of datasets included.
    One of the best known certainly is "mtcars".
    There's a set of useful commands you can use to find out things about your dataset.
    For example, type head(mtcars,10) to see the first 10 rows.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('head(mtcars,10)')
  Hint: Just type head(mtcars,10).      
  
  #53
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: This doesn't show the data types of the columns.
    Often, the first command one might use would be str(), which shows data types, example values and certain summary information.
    Try this on mtcars now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('str(mtcars)')
  Hint: Just type str(mtcars). 

  #54
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another very useful command is summary(). To see what it gets you, type summary(mtcars) now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('summary(mtcars)')
  Hint: Just type summary(mtcars). 
  
  #55
- Class: text
  Output: You'll learn a lot more about data.frames in subsequent chapters. Let's now wrap up the data types topic with the last available combination...
  
  #56
- Class: text
  Output: ... arrays, for homogeneous objects of more than 2 dimensions.
    There is no comparable datatype for heterogeneous containers.
  
  #57
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We use a similar technique here as with matrices. Create an array a like this.
    a <- array(1:64, dim = c(2,8,4))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(' a <- array(1:64, dim = c(2,8,4))')
  Hint: Just type  a <- array(1:64, dim = c(2,8,4)).   
  
  #58
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now inspect the resulting array (print it).
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('a','print(a)')
  Hint: Just type a.   
  
  #59
- Class: text
  Output: We'll see how to extract elements from arrays in the next lesson. For now, that's it!
    You now know the compound data types available in R!
