#1
- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we'll look at plotting with R.

#2
- Class: text
  Output: There are several plotting systems in R, the most important of which, as of today, is ggplot2.
    However, there is an amazing lot of things you can do with base R.
    We'll start with base R and then quickly move on to ggplot2.

#3
- Class: text
  Output: Many objects in R have their own plot methods, so you can simply call plot on them and get an adequate output.
    We'll look at some examples soon. First, however, we'll plot some simple data ourselves.
    
#4
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Please now create a vector called xvec consisting of the numbers from 1 to 100.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('xvec <- 1:100')
  Hint: Just type xvec <- 1:100.

#5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, create a vector yvec as the sum of xvec and a random error. Type yvec <- xvec + rnorm(100, sd = 5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('yvec <- xvec + rnorm(100, sd = 5)')
  Hint: Just type yvec <- xvec + rnorm(100, sd = 5).
  
#6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, all you have to do to create a scatterplot of yvec versus xvec is call plot on them!
    That is, the minimal syntax for default plot is plot(<x>, <y>), or, with parameters, plot(x = <x>, y = <y>).
    Please do this now.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('plot(x = xvec, y = yvec)', 'plot(xvec, yvec)')
  Hint: Just type plot(x = xvec, y = yvec).
  
#7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you want a different kind of plot, you use the type parameter.
    Now instead of a scatterplot please create a lines plot (the value for type is 'l')
  AnswerTests: omnitest("plot(x = xvec, y = yvec, type='l')")
  Hint: Just type plot(x = xvec, y = yvec, type='l')

#8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can easily name the x and y axes, and give the plot a title, using the xlab, ylab, and main parameters, respectively.
    Do this now, please, naming the x-axis "timeline", the y-axis "returns", and the plot itself "Returns over time".
  AnswerTests: omnitest("plot(x = xvec, y = yvec, type='l', xlab = 'timeline', ylab = 'returns', main = 'Returns over time')")
  Hint: Just type > plot(x = xvec, y = yvec, type='l', xlab = 'timeline', ylab = 'returns', main = 'Returns over time')

#9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we've seen scatterplots and line plots.
    To plot a histogram, you use the hist() function instead of plot.
    hist creates the histogram and plots it right away.
    Try this with the cyl column of the mtcars dataset now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('hist(mtcars$cyl)')
  Hint: Just type hist(mtcars$cyl).
  
#10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another plot type you might want to use is a boxplot. Boxplots show the distribution of a variable.
    Try this with the wt column of the mtcars dataset now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('boxplot(mtcars$wt)')
  Hint: Just type boxplot(mtcars$wt).
  
  
#11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Before we move on to ggplot2, here are examples of objects that have implemented their own plot method.
    For example, data.frame. Call plot on the mtcars dataset now to see what happens.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('plot(mtcars)')
  Hint: Just type plot(mtcars).  
 
  
#12
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Functions have a plot method, too. See what happens if you enter plot(sin,-3,3).
  AnswerTests: omnitest('plot(sin,-3,3)')
  Hint: Just type plot(sin,-3,3). 
 
#13
- Class: text
  Output: R's basic plotting system is great, but to create production quality graphics and/or more complex plots you would use ggplot2.
 
#14
- Class: text
  Output: Behind ggplot2 there's a whole "grammar of graphics" and we can only touch the basics here.

#15
- Class: text
  Output: ggplot works by first creating a coordinate system (an empty graph) and then adding layers to it.
    In the first step, you call the ggplot function with the dataset you're working on.

#16
- Class: text
  Output: We've already loaded the ggplot2 library and the diamonds dataset, which comes with it.
    Let's start by creating an empty graph and storing it in a variable, like this
 
#17
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: g <- ggplot(data = diamonds). Do this now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('g <- ggplot(data = diamonds)')
  Hint: Just type g <- ggplot(data = diamonds).    
  
#18
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, display g to see what you got.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('g')
  Hint: Just type g.  
  
#19
- Class: text
  Output: Now we can add layers to the graph. Adding layers means adding "geoms", which are different types of visuals like scatterplots, histograms, etc.
  
#20
- Class: text
  Output: The geom_<> functions need to know what aspect of the visual ("aesthetics", in ggplot language) to map to which part of the data.
    For example, what should the x- and y-axes represent?
  
#21
- Class: text
  Output: For that, every geom_<> function takes a "mapping" argument, and in that argument, you map aesthetics to variables.
    
#22
- Class: text
  Output: Adding a layer to our empty plot g, we thus create a scatterplot of price by carat like this 
    
#23
- Class: text
  Output: g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
  
#24
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type the above command now, and you'll get the plot.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))')
  Hint: Just type g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)). 
  
#25
- Class: text
  Output: We can map further variables to other aesthetics.
    For example, we can use color to distinguish between different cuts. Type
    
#26
- Class: text
  Output: g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))
  
#27
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: to try this out.  
  AnswerTests: omnitest('g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))')
  Hint: Just type g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)).   
  
#28
- Class: text
  Output: Something else you might want to do is display several plots, one for each setting of a (categorical) variable.
    You do this using facet_wrap(~ <variable name>), where ~ is R's formula syntax. 
    For example, to create a separate plot for every value of cut, type
    
#29
- Class: text
  Output: g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + facet_wrap(~ cut)
  
#30
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just type this now to see the result.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + facet_wrap(~ cut)')
  Hint: Just type g + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + facet_wrap(~ cut).    
  

#31
- Class: text
  Output: There is an alternative syntax that is useful if you want to add several geoms.
    You can specify mappings already in the ggplot() call. The mappings you specify there are used for all geoms that follow.
    So an alternative way to draw the above plot would be

#32
- Class: text
  Output: ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()


#33
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just type this now to see the result is the same.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()')
  Hint: Just type ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point().    
  

#34
- Class: text
  Output: Now imagine we want to add a smoothing line to our scatterplot of price versus carat.
    We can do this by adding another geom, geom_smooth, like this
    

#35
- Class: text
  Output: ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
  
#36
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type this now to see what happens.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()')
  Hint: Just type ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth().    
    

#46
- Class: text
  Output: Now it's your turn! You're going to do some plots of the mtcars dataset.

  
#47
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, look at the first rows of mtcars again to see what variables it contains.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('head(mtcars)')
  Hint: Just type head(mtcars).   

#48
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now create a scatterplot of mpg by wt.
    For reference, the syntax used above was ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point().
  AnswerTests: omnitest('ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point()')
  Hint: Just type ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point().  
  
#49
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, please do the same, but add a smoothing line.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()')
  Hint: Just type ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth().  

#55  
- Class: text
  Output: OK, that's it for plotting!
    There are many more things you can do with ggplot2, but it takes a bit of practice to get accustomed to the syntax, so don't worry if you have to look it up often in the beginning.
