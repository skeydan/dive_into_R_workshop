#1
- Class: text
  Output: Now that we know the basics of R, let's jump right into the tidyverse - Hadley Wickham's famous collection of packages that allow for intuitive, uniform and elegant data handling in R.
  
#2
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For SQL-like data manipulation, it is the dplyr library we need.
    Go ahead and load dplyr now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('library(dplyr)')
  Hint: Just type library(dplyr).
  
#3
- Class: text
  Output: With dplyr, you can filter, select and order data with an elegant, SQL-like syntax.
    We'll start with filtering. 
    
#4
- Class: text
  Output: We'll use the longley macroeconomic dataset.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('data("longley")')
  Hint: Just type data("longley")

#5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Look at the first rows to see what's contained in the dataset.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('head(longley)')
  Hint: Just type head(longley).
  
#6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How many rows does the dataset contain?
  AnswerTests: omnitest('nrow(longley)')
  Hint: Just type nrow(longley).
  
#7
- Class: text
  Output:  To filter the rows, you use the filter() function.
    filter() gets passed a dataset and a predicate.
    For example, this is how you'd filter the dataset so it contains just rows where Year > 1959
    
#8
- Class: text
  Output:  filter(longley, Year > 1959)
    
#9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Filters can be ANDed using & and ORed using |.
    Now filter the dataset, keeping just rows where Year > 1959 or GNP > 460.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('filter(longley, Year > 1959 | GNP > 460)')
  Hint: Just type filter(longley, Year > 1959 | GNP > 460).
  
#10
- Class: text
  Output:  With filtering, there is a nice SQL-like syntax that lets you test whether a value is one of several "admitted" values.
    For example, to check for rows where Year is one of 1951, 1954, or 1959, you write

#11
- Class: text
  Output:  filter(longley, Year %in% c(1951,1954,1959))
  
  
#12
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So please now filter the dataset again, this time keeping just rows where the rounded value of Population is between 120 and 123.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('filter(longley, round(Population) %in% c(120,121,122,123))', 'filter(longley, round(Population) %in% 120:123)')
  Hint: Just type filter(longley, round(Population) %in% 120:123)
  
#13
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Did you think that if there's a SQL-like %in%, probably there's a between too?
    Indeed there is. The syntax is between(<value>,<lower>,<upper>).
    Use between now to get the same result as above.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('filter(longley, between(round(Population), 120,123))')
  Hint: Just type filter(longley, between(round(Population), 120,123)) 

#17
- Class: text
  Output: Now that we know how to filter rows, we probably also want to sort them.
  
#18
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Sorting is done using arrange(<dataset>,<sort_column>).
    Go ahead and sort the dataset by the value of Unemployed now.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('arrange(longley,Unemployed)')
  Hint: Just type arrange(longley,Unemployed)

#19
- Class: text
  Output: As you see, by default arrange() does an ascending sort.
    You can do a descending sort instead using arrange(<dataset>, desc(<sort_column>)).
  
#20
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now please do a descending sort by GNP of the filtered dataset, keeping just the rows where Year < 1958.
    (Do the filter step first.)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('arrange(filter(longley, Year < 1958), desc(GNP))')
  Hint: Just type arrange(filter(longley, Year < 1958), desc(GNP))
  
#21
- Class: text
  Output: Until now, we've always kept all the variables in the dataframe.
    What if we only want Year, Employed and GNP?
    We can use select() to just select certain columns, like this

#22
- Class: text
  Output: select(longley, Year, Employed, GNP)
  
#23
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: OK! Now combine select, filter and arrange to display the Year and GNP of all rows where Year > 1960, ordering the data by GNP.
    (Please use arrange, filter and select in this order in your expression.)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('arrange(filter(select(longley, Year, GNP), Year > 1960), GNP)')
  Hint: Just type arrange(filter(select(longley, Year, GNP), Year > 1960), GNP)
  
#24
- Class: text
  Output: Did you think this was a lot of parentheses to write?
    Luckily, dplyr offers a different way to chain commands - the pipe.
    
#25
- Class: text
  Output: Like the unix pipe, dplyr's pipe allows you to write code in a fluent API style, writing "as you think".

#26
- Class: text
  Output: The pipe operator, written %>%, pipes the output of every command in a chain as input to the next.
    With the pipe, you can rewrite the above query like this

#27    
- Class: text
  Output: longley %>% select(GNP) %>% filter(Year > 1960)  %>% arrange(GNP)
  
#28  
- Class: text
  Output: Remember how, for example, filter takes two or more arguments, the dataset and one or more predicates?
  
#29    
- Class: text
  Output: Now with the %>% syntax, we just pass in the predicate(s) because the dataset is automatically passed to filter by the %>%.
  
#30  
- Class: text
  Output: Now it's your turn to get used to the %>%! Let's switch to another dataset though, for variety's sake. It's called "InsectSprays."
    
#32
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Have a look at how InsectSprays is structured. (Use the str() function so you get additional information about what values exist.)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('str(InsectSprays)')
  Hint: Just type str(InsectSprays).
  
#33
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, using the %>%, filter InsectSprays, just keeping rows for spray B.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("InsectSprays %>% filter(spray == 'B')")
  Hint: Just type  InsectSprays %>% filter(spray == 'B').
  
#34
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great! Now, building on the above query, order the remaining rows by count.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("InsectSprays %>% filter(spray == 'B') %>% arrange(count)")
  Hint: Just type InsectSprays %>% filter(spray == 'B') %>% arrange(count).  
  
#35
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, again building on what you did before, just keep the count column.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("InsectSprays %>% filter(spray == 'B') %>% arrange(count) %>% select(count)")
  Hint: Just type InsectSprays %>% filter(spray == 'B') %>% arrange(count) %>% select(count) .   

#36  
- Class: text
  Output: How about adding new variables to a dataset? 
    You use mutate(<dataset>, <newvar> = expression) for that.

#37
- Class: text
  Output: Try this out now. Add a new variable, logcount, to InsectSprays.
    It's supposed to be the (natural) log of count.
  
#38
- Class: text
  Output: There's one thing to pay attention to, though.
    In spite of its name, mutate() doesn't mutate the original dataset, but returns a new one.
    So you have to either assign the result to the variable holding the original dataset, or to a different variable.
  
  
#39
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Just assign the result to the variable newSprays now.
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('newSprays <- InsectSprays %>% mutate(logcount = log(count))','newSprays <- mutate(InsectSprays, logcount = log(count))')
  Hint: Just type newSprays <- InsectSprays %>% mutate(logcount = log(count)).
  
#40
- Class: text
  Output: OK! That's all very nice but ...if you're used to working with SQL, there must be something you're missing - group by!
  
#41
- Class: text
  Output: Sure, there'a group by in dplyr.
    It's called group_by, and it's called with the dataset and the column(s) you want to group by.
    If you use the %>%, it could look like this (remember, no need to pass the dataset)
   
#42    
- Class: text
  Output:  InsectSprays %>% group_by(spray)

#43    
- Class: text
  Output: However, there's no use to grouping data if you don't calculate aggregate values (sums, averages, counts...) for the groups!
    With dplyr, you do this using summarise(), passing in the dataset (only if you don't use the %>%!) and the aggregation function(s).
    Like this, for example
    
#44    
- Class: text
  Output: InsectSprays %>% group_by(spray) %>% summarise(mean(count))

#45    
- Class: text
  Output: You can also directly name the new, aggregate variable. Like this
  
#46    
- Class: text
  Output: InsectSprays %>% group_by(spray) %>% summarise(avg_count = mean(count))
  
#47
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How about you find the maximum count per spray now? 
    Just call it max_count.
  AnswerTests: omnitest("InsectSprays %>% group_by(spray) %>% summarise(max_count = max(count))")
  Hint: Just type InsectSprays %>% group_by(spray) %>% summarise(max_count = max(count)).  
   
#48
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To wrap up, let's do some summarizing on a different dataset.
    Remember mtcars? Look at the first rows again. 
  AnswerTests: omnitest("head(mtcars)")
  Hint: Just type head(mtcars).  
  
#49
- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the mean mpg for automatic transmission (am = 0)? Round the value to 1 digit after the comma.
    Please type play() now, find out the answer, and then come back, using nxt().
    In case you've already done that, now type your answer at the prompt.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('17.1')
  Hint: Just type play() first and then, you could do something like mtcars %>% group_by(am) %>% summarise(mean(mpg)) %>% round(1).
  

#50
- Class: exact_question
  Output: Look at the maximum mpg by number of cylinders. Which number of cylinders has the maximum mpg?
    Please type play() now, find out the answer, and then come back, using nxt().
    In case you've already done that, now type your answer at the prompt.
  AnswerTests: omnitest('4')
  Hint: Just type play() first and then, you could do something like mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarise(max(mpg)).
  

#54    
- Class: text
  Output: OK, that's it for querying data now! See you in the plotting lesson.
